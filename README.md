## Getting Started

1. **First, initialize a new project and install Node Dependencies**
   Simply run

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

2. **Start the site in `dev` mode.**

    Next, move into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up:

    ```shell
    cd my-app
    npm run dev
    ```

3. **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:3000`.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
